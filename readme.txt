This plugin removes the reminders that you should register plugins you got by a theme for example

== Description ==

This plguin simply adds a CSS code into your Admin Dashboard and hides most of the nagging messages telling you 
that you should activate or register other GPL 2 Plugins.

It doesn't add any functions other than adding the CSS code, so there should be no trouble with other plugins you are using.

== Screenshots ==

1. We target these messages

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Thats it, nothing to configure
